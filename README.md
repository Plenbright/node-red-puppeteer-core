## Introduction

This package adds browser automation features using puppeteer-core to Node-RED. This package was inspired by [node-red-contrib-puppeteer](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-puppeteer) and [node-red-contrib-puppeteer](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-puppeteer) and [node-red-contrib-puppeteer](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-puppeteer).

This package is build to work tightly with the browserless service. You can use the browserless service for free with a limited number of requests per month. You can also use your own browserless service or your own puppeteer-core installation.
